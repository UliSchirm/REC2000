# REC2000

This is a small python software which transfers data from Zeiss Elta total stations to a computer via serial to USB adapter cable.

## Zeiss Elta

The Zeiss Elta (**El**ektronisches **Ta**chymeter) total stations were produced by Zeiss Jena in Germany in the 1990ies. Old stocks are still available around germany and are sold at reasonable prices.

Essentially, two different types were produced:
* REC Elta 13, 14, 15
* Elta 13, 14, 15

The diffenrence is that the "REC" types were able to store data in the device, whereas the types without "REC" could only spend data on the fly.
